<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>
  &diams; While existing network verification tools focus almost exclusively on different variants of reachability, can we verify <b>liveness properties</b> at scale? <br><br>
  &diams; Given a <b>combinational property</b>, i.e., a property that falls under both safety and liveness criteria, can we decompose it to <b>safety-only</b> and <b>liveness-only</b> properties? <br><br>
  &diams; Can we verify the <b>latency</b> of modern large-scale networks with <b>packet-level granularity</b>?
</p>
<p>
  Below, we highlight the <a href="http://soudeh.net/#research">research</a> conducted by <a href="http://soudeh.net/#bio">our team</a> to answer these questions.
</p>

<h2>Scalable liveness verification</h2>
<p>
  We argue that the goal of verifying liveness properties is achievable using a <b>top-down function-oriented strategy</b> that rethinks network abstractions with the efficiency of verification in mind.

  Contributions:
  <ul class="val-list-parent">
    <li class="val-list"><b>Abstraction:</b> We provide network programmers with a simple, familiar abstraction of one big switch to express their intent. This abstraction enforces the logical separation of different network functions.</li>
    <li class="val-list"><b>Packet-less model:</b> We model the program as a compact packet-less data structure that abstracts away the explicit notion of packets and focuses instead on the entities responsible for implementing functions (packet handling rules).</li>
    <li class="val-list"><b>P4 compiler:</b> We provide a compiler that translates the programs written using our abstraction to P4 programs.</li>
  </ul>
  
</p>

<h3>Our abstraction is expressive.</h3>
<p>
  Our one big switch abstraction is designed to be capable of performing similar computations and is therefore 
  expressive enough to program a wide range of network functions. Table below lists the
  functions of a few common control planes and recent network
  abstractions that we re-wrote on top of our abstraction <br><br>

<h3>Our model is fast.</h3>
<p>
  Below, Figure (a) and (b) show examples for a UDP flood mitigation function which deploys a per-source IP counter that is incremented for every UDP
  packet and starts dropping packets when the counter exceeds a threshold. Figure (c) and (d) show examples for an “absence” property 
  (host A is never reachable) and “universality” (A is always reachable), respectively. The results demonstrate that packet-less verification 
  significantly reduces the verification time of different properties for a flood mitigation function.

<h2>Property decomposition</h2>

<h2>Packet-level latency verification</h2>
<p>
  Albeit faster than their current simulation-based counterparts, the state-of-the-art verifiers today
  have major limitations such as not modeling failures or latency that prevent
  them from reliably verifying latency. We bridge this gap by proposing a scalable latency verification
  method that refines advanced abstract network models to enable fast latency verification.
  <br><br>
  Contributions:
  <ul class="val-list-parent">
    <li class="val-list"><b>Temporal verification:</b> We decompose the latency verification task
      into two phases: (i) functional verification, in which we
      compute the probability of two nodes being reachable under various network states, and (ii) temporal verification, in
      which we calculate the probability of reaching a node
      from another one below the user-specified latency bound.</li>
    <li class="val-list"><b>Optimization:</b> We propose novel caching mechanisms that speed up the verification process.</li>
    <li class="val-list"><b>Implementation:</b> We implement our verifier, i.e., Tempus, in Julia and evaluate it under various scales of datacenter and wide area networks..</li>
  </ul>

  The architecture of Tempus:

<h3>Tempus is fast.</h3>
<p>
  We run Tempus on various scales of k-ary fat-tree topology with 100 Gbps links under 25%
  load and compare the verification time with the time taken for simulating all failure scenarios using the state-of-the-art
  network simulators. For this purpose, we use OMNeT++ (a non-parallel packet-level network simulator), Parsimon (a parallel flow-level simulator), and DONS
  (a parallel packet-level simulator). We observe that tempus is orders of magnitude faster than all these simulators:<br><br>

  ''αy βmo γd δh ηmin κs’’ represents α years, β months, γ days, δ hours, η minutes, and κ seconds.
</p>

<h3>Tempus is accurate.</h3>
<p>
  To evaluate the accuracy of Tempus, we simulate the
  no-failure scenario and various degrees of load in a two-tier leaf-spine topology using
  OMNeT++ and measure the tail (99th percentile) packet-level delay. We repeat the
  simulations ten times to capture various randomnesses caused
  by the simulator. For Tempus, we input the network topology
  and the empirical queueing time measurements from our
  simulations and record the tail latency estimated
  by Tempus for the no-failure scenario. We observe that,
  irrespective of the load, Tempus accurately captures the upper
  limit for the tail delay:<br><br>

  The box and whisker plots represent distinct tail latencies
  recorded as we repeat the simulations multiple times.
